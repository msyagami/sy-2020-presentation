Welcome to my demo of SY 2020-2021 portfolio!

Frontend repo is [here](https://github.com/msyagami/sy-2021-presentation-backend). And preview is [available here](https://msyagami-sy-2021-presentation.vercel.app/).

## ‚¨á Installing

You will need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 12 and above installed.

You will also need [a Strapi application](https://strapi.io/documentation) running to provide the information to be displayed.

## üåê Deployment

I recommend [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com/) to deploy this since this is the recommended deployment site by [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/). [Doc here](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment)

Pricing may vary, but the free tier works.
