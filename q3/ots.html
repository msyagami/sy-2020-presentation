                    <p>Hannah dedicates Samuel to the Lord and blesses her by Eli the priest in Shiloh. Samuel ministered before the Lord under Eli, but Eli's sons Hophni and Phinehas were sinners against God's laws. The Lord said to Samuel on his dreams that Eli will be punished for Eli failed to restrain his sons' sins.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Philistines stole the Ark of God from Shiloh and offers it to a god. Because of that war, Eli's sons died. After Eli heard the news, he also died. The Philistines eventually returned the Ark to Israel because of too much plagues occuring in their land.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Samuel, being the leader of Mizpah, assembled the people and said that they should only serve the Lord and confess their sins. The Philistines heard that the Mizpah was assembling, they were planning for an attack. Samuel insisted that they will be protected by the Lord. By the time Samuel was sacrificing their offering, the Philistines we're drawn near but failed to get close due to the loud thunders the Lord made for the Mizpah and they reclaim the lost territory of Israel.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Samuel became the leader in Israel, and when he grew old he appoined his sons Joel and Abijah as judges. His people were demanding for a king to rule over them, but Lord was doubtful of this and eventually gave Israel a king. __And he was Saul from Benjamin.__ </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Saul was a good ruler, protected Israel, won a lot of military victories and Samuel trusted him. But when the Lord asked Saul to attack the Amalekites for what they did to Israel, Saul did attack Amalek, but spared the flocks and the Amalekites' leader. Samuel got mad, rebukes Saul, the Lord regretted for choosing Saul as king, and both Samuel and the Lord appoints a new king. __David, son of Jesse__.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Before David became a king, he worked for Saul's court as his armor-bearer and commanded to play the lyre. Saul's son, Jonathan befriended David and sees him as the new and rightful king. David encountered Goliath, people were telling David that he can't battle Goliath, David disregarded their opinions and attacked the giant, chopped the head and the Philistines and Saul feared David. Saul was envious about David, so he tried to plot a murder, but Jonathan warned David about what he heard. David escaped, told Samuel what Saul had done to him.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>David travelled to Nob, to Gath, to Adullam and kept his cover low, but he eventually got spotted during his visit at Nob. Saul commanded to kill the priests at Nob for being loyal to David. David was informed about the massacre by Ahitub, son of Ahimelek, and told to stay with him. They both travelled and saw Keilah being attacked by the Philistines. David saved Keilah and was seen by the men of Saul. Eventually David encountered Saul and spared his life and both parted ways.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>David joins the Philistines, Saul asked for Samuel's words of wisdom. But Samuel the harsh truth, and he was filled with great fear. David eventually attacked the long overdue Amalekites, fought against Israel, killed David's best friend Jonathan, and Saul's life has been taken.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>David heard about Saul's death, he commanded to kill the one who killed Saul, and lamented Saul and Jonathan. David became the new king of Judah and went on wars with Saul's son Ish-bosheth. Eventually Ish-bosheth was murdered by David's men, and offered the dead man's head to David. David was not happy because his men killed the anointed and commanded to kill the two men. Since there are no rulers present in other places in Israel, he was now anointed as the king of Israel.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>During David's reign, he conquers Jerusalem, defeates the Philistines, obtaines the Ark, builds a temple by the son of Nathan, defeated the Moabites, the Edomites, took Jonathan's son with him to repay Jonathan's kindness, defeats the Ammonites. Nathan rebuked David for comitting adultery on Uriah the Hittite, whom, he also killed. Nathan also mentioned the David's first son with Bathsheba will die as a punishment. David pleaded to the Lord, fasted, and lied in sackcloth, but on the seventh day the child died. David thought the Lord might spare him for the sin he did but when he heard the child died, he stopped fasting and lying in sackcloths.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>David sent Uriah on a suicide mission, making the Lord angry to him. The Lord causes disasters on David's house. Ammon, one of David's sons rapes his half-sister Tamar, also one of David's daugthers. Absalom, another one of David's sons killed Ammon and rebels against his father, only to be killed during the Battle of Ephraim. David escapes from Jerusalem, and restored as king and returned to his palace. His only sons, Solomon, son of David and Bathsheba, and Adonijah, son of David and Haggith.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>A famine occured during David's reign, the Gibeonites avenged Saul by killing Saul's descendants, except Mephibosheth, and a war emerged again against the Philistines, David crafted a song for the Lord for thanksgiving, wrote is "last words", listed his 37 mighty warriors and trained them, a plague happened because of David's sinful census, and built an Altar for the Lord to stop the famine.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since we're only summarizing 1 & 2 Samuel, this is where it ends. Solomon became king, appointed by David, whom he faked his death just for Solomon to rule, and story of the divided kingdom has begun.</p>
