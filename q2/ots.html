                    <p>The story of Ruth plays a big role for the future books of the Bible.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ruth got married to the sons of Elimelech. But 10 years later, his husband died. Her
                        mother-in-law Naomi, prepared her and her sister-in-law Orpah, to go back to Judah.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Orpah followed her mother-in-law's decision, but Ruth sticked with her.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>People we’re shocked that Naomi and Ruth we’re still alive. Naomi said to call her Mara because
                        the Lord made her life "very bitter" and "brought misfortune". (1:20-21 NIV) </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ruth started to glean crops for her mother-in-law and encountered with Boaz. Ruth helped the
                        women of Boaz to glean his crops until Naomi tells Ruth to “rest”. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Ruth moved out, got married to Boaz, and bores a son. Also known as the grandfather of David, the
                        ancestor of Christ. (Luke 3:32)</p>
