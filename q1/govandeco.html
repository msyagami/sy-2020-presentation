                        <p>There are three branches of government. First is the Executive, who enforces the law that the Legislative branch (more on that later!) makes. 
                            The President is the chief executive, and is chosen by electing. The presidential election is for US citizens at the age of 18 on their respective states. After the electing and voting, the votes are tallied by the Electoral College based on "points", 
                            but still can win by highest votes.</p>
                        <p>‎‎‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
                        <p>The Legislative branch is also known as the Congress. Contains the 100 senators, and 435 House of Representatives. The senators are chosen by pairs per state, and the Representatives are decided by the population of the state. 
                            So, it's normal that one state has 2 Representative, while the other state has 40. 
                            They are also required to go to an election phase before performing certain actions.</p>
                        <p>‎‎‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
                        <p>The Judicial branch interprets what the Constitution means, hear issues related to the Constitution. They are the highest court in the country. It is usually composed the
                             Supreme Court, and the 9 Justices and lower-level courts and also Special courts to handle other federal cases.</p>
