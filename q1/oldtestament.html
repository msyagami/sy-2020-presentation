                        <p>Joseph, son of Jacob and Rachel, was born in Haran. Left his hometown with his family at age six to move at Canaan, but eventually settling in Hebron.</p>
                        <p>‎‎‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
                        <p>Jacob showed loved to Joseph by giving him a robe. Joseph’s brothers got jealous and mad at him, so his brothers decided to throw him into a pit and sold him 
                            by a passing trader. The trader brought him to Egypt and he was sold to Potiphar.</p>
                        <p>‎‎‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
                        <p>Joseph managed to survive. He was successful to his master and due to his looks, his mater’s wife desire to be intimate with him. 
                            When his master found out knew what happened, Joseph was sent to 
                            prison but the warden appointed him as the right-hand man. One of Joseph’s unique quality is to 
                            interpret dreams and give meaning to it. He was able to explain the dreams and Joseph’s predictions were right. </p>
                        <p>‎‎‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
                        <p>Two years after the prediction, King Pharaoh had two dreams that none of his advisors weren’t to explain it. Then he remembered 
                            Joseph about being able to interpret dreams. The Pharaoh summoned Joseph. Joseph was able to interpret it. 
                            Egypt suffered from plenty for seven years, and famine for seven years, as Joseph predicted.</p>
                        <p>‎‎‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
                        <p>Due to Joseph’s wisdom, he was appointed as his viceroy, second to the king, and the one who prepared Egypt for famine. The famine was also felt near Canaan, 
                            hearing there’s some grain in Egypt, Joseph’s brothers travelled there to buy food, not realizing that they would encounter their brother whom they threw and sold. 
                            Joseph took this opportunity to see if they (Joseph’s brothers) if they did regret about losing him. He tested them by having to bring Benjamin, Joseph’s youngest 
                            brother to him.</p>
                        <p>‎‎‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
                        <p>When Joseph saw their devotion to Benjamin, Joseph revealed his true identity to his brothers, 
                            and The Pharaoh let Joseph’s family and Joseph’s brother’s wives and children to live at the land of Goshen in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>‎‎‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
                        <p>Pharaoh gave Joseph a wife, Asenath, daughter of Potiphar. (Joseph’s former master), had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. He ruled Egypt for 80 years until his death. He was able to live for 110 years. 
                            Before he died, he said to his brothers to take his coffin with them when they leave Egypt for the Promised Land. Moses, 
                            the Prophet, made sure that Joseph’s tomb and carry his remains in Israel.</p>
